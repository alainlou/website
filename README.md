This is my personal website. It has my portfolio, some active projects, and allows me to test out some stuff.

Things I tested here:
* [DaysLeft](http://alainlou.com/daysleft), a countdown to high school graduation for my grade. In the background there's some music that I wrote in imitation of popular EDM producers. If you want to see countdown messages, change the date on your device to before June 2018.

* [Subscript](http://alainlou.com/subscript), a text input box that supports UTF-8 (mostly for Google Chrome and Firefox) subscript input (buttons and also converting any inputted number into its subscript from). This was used as part of a learning platform to help with inputting molecular formulas.
