I've been working on this post for some time but it's been on the backburner while some other higher priority things pre-empted this. I think my perspective on a few of these experiences have changed, especially the takeaways. In the moment when they are written, everything seems clear, but as someone continues to gather life experience, it's inevitable that some views will shift. All in all, 2022 was still a year of big changes and reflecting on that has made me wanting more of that.

I was very lucky to have had an amazing past year. I've grown in many ways and found out a lot about myself and the world out there. Along the way, I've met some amazing people and gone through some wild adventures. It really feels like I'm some kind of Age of Exploration captain returning to the "Old World". I'm coming back a changed man: more self-confident, more worldly and hopefully a better human being.

# Movement 1: The Exchange Term
### Stranger in a Strange Land
After predeparture and arrival in Singapore, there was quite a bit of adjusting to do. Combined with the 7 day mandatory quarantine, it was very easy to feel disoriented and lost. My dad has a friend in Singapore so I defered to him a lot of my intitial questions (especially regarding the strict COVID policies).

For one, it's hot and humid in Singapore, which is a nice break from the Canadian winter, but it also means that it rains _a lot_ and it is very easy to sweat _a lot_. Singlish is different from North American English and it takes some time getting used to it.

### Finding my people
There were 5 Canadian exchangers on the same flight as me

### Trying things
#### Being an extrovert
#### Losing some innocence
Getting drunk, vomiting
Hitting on girls
Being a child again
#### Traveling like a European in Vietnam

### Saying goodbye

# Movement 2: Summer in Chicago
Coming off the exchange high,
### People can be boring? I can be arrogant?

# Movement 3: Return to Waterloo
### Snap back to reality
Coming back to
### Things I've given up

# Coda: Key Themes
### Self-determination
I used to think that appearance mattered a lot, that's why I'd sit around and wait.

### Environment
### How to find happiness
#### Recreating the same experience
Looking for new experiences is usually better than trying to recreate old ones
### Judging people is sometimes okay
small vs big friend circle
### Working on it
keeping in touch
you have your end of the bargain to hold up
"not me me me"
stop expecting things
