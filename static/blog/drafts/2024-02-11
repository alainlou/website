It hasn't been easy to settle in to the full-time life. Part of this has definitely been a mismatch of expections versus reality, but in many ways it's a realization that in the end I am alone - independent, free, liberated, but alone.

### Theme 1: put on a happy face

Forcing yourself to be in a good mood.

### Theme 2: Shifu and Po
Kung Fu Panda is one of my favorite movies. In Master Oogway's last scene before disappearing in a flurry of flower petals, he instructs Shifu to let go of his illusion of control. Shifu argues using a peach pit as a metaphor for Po (a student he is teaching) - he can control where the seed is planted, when the fruit will fall, the seed cannot help but grow into a peach tree, though Shifu might wish for an apple or orange. Oogway

There is no secret ingredient.

### Theme 3: (self-)discipline

burnout from looking

David Goggins

Self-love

tentative careful, important first step
