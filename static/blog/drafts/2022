experiences (month by month)
feelings
1. rebirth

lessons
1. whatever you do, do it with some sense of urgency
2. make yourself uncomfortable
  - it takes energy to set things up and plan, appreciate when others do this
3. sometimes you just don't vibe with people
  - are you stuck with them?
    - find others
    - find things that they CAN talk about
  - are they unsympathetic?
    - bopes
  - can you fix them?
    - you can't really just tell something
    - you have to make them feel something
      - make them feel upset? that's risky

regrets
1. india
2. expecting different at waterloo but not putting enough effort to changing it
  - maybe not opening up enough to people at waterloo

plans
- keep in touch
