stuff that happened:
- a girl thought I liked her
- a boy thought I liked him

- it's easy to make friends, just need to be social (invite people for stuff)
- making friends has little to do with how attractive you are, more about behaviour (treating people right, wanting to do stuff with people)

high energy, low energy

some people you can just be high energy with (Erin)

other times you are low energy but you want to be high energy

ig FOMO
I think i got over it (but not really)

you really can make friends easily (just be more open)
- careful that you don't overcommit, also careful you don't turn too introverted (just say no for no reason)

you really can do things you want to do (just ask if people want to do something, 9/10 say ok i feel)
